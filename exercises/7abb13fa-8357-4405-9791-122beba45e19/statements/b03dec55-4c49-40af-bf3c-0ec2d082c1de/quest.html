<h4> Dominant </h4>
<br>
<p> Write a program that reads a sequence of natural numbers separated by spaces, and returns the z
them which occurs the greatest number of times. If more than one number occurs so many
same (most) times, just return the first one. </p>
<br>
<p> Examples of operation: </p>
<p> The following form of interpretation (user) => (computer) </p>
<ol>
<code> 3 12 3 4 => 3 </code>
<br> <code> 7 4 1 1 7 1 => 1 </code>
<br> <code> 2 3 => 2 </code>
</ol>
<p> The program does not have to display the number of times the numbers are repeated, it only has to display the number witch repetes in the sequence at most (dominates). </p> <br>
<p> If you would like to test how your code works, feel free to use the example above. </p>
